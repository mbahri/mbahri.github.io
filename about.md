<!-- I am a Machine Learning researcher in training and will be starting my PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at Imperial College London in October. Previously, I was a research intern at [Speechmatics (Cantab Research Ltd.)](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I worked on improving the company's recurrent neural network language models. Prior to this, I was a Data Scientist at [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk) in London. I graduated with an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, and a *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* in Applied Mathematics and CS from Ensimag (Grenoble). -->

## Current research interests

Besides what I do at work, I am interested in a variety of topics in Machine Learning, notably in statistical learning and optimisation.

* Non-euclidean geometry in Machine Learning (manifold learning, Riemannian optimisation)
* Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models
* Representation learning and component analysis
* Tensor methods, sparse coding, compressed sensing (see my MSc thesis)
* Social network analysis, more precisely influence propagation

My preferred applications are in, computer vision and medical research.
