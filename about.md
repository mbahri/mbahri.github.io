![The author in Vienna](../assets/images/me.jpg)

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer. I am currently finishing a research internship at [Speechmatics (Cantab Research Ltd.)](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I am working on improving the company's recurrent neural network language models. Prior to this, I was a Data Scientist at [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk) in London. I graduated with an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, and a *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* in Applied Mathematics and CS from Ensimag (Grenoble).

See my [Curriculum Vitae](http://bahri.io/Bahri_CV.pdf) or my short [Resume](http://bahri.io/Bahri_resume.pdf).

## Current research interests

Besides what I do at work, I am interested in a variety of topics in Machine Learning, notably in statistical learning and optimisation.

* Non-euclidean geometry in Machine Learning (manifold learning, Riemannian optimisation)
* Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models
* Representation learning and component analysis
* Tensor methods, sparse coding, compressed sensing (see my MSc thesis)
* Social network analysis, more precisely influence propagation

My preferred applications are in data science, computer vision, and medical research.
