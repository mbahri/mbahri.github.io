I have been invited to attend the second Google Computer Vision Summit in Zurich
in September 2018.

The Computer Vision Summit is a 3-day short conference on Computer Vision at
Google, with talks regarding the research done at Google and how it is applied
to the company's product. The Summit is also a great opportunity to meet Google
scientists and fellow PhD students and post-docs from all over Europe.

I will be presenting a poster on my work on robust tensor factorizations and
dictionary learning.

I am grateful to be one of the lucky 60-or-so students invited to the Summit!
