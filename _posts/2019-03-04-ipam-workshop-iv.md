I will be attending [Workshop IV: Deep Geometric Learning of Big Data and Applications]("http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-iv-deep-geometric-learning-of-big-data-and-applications/") of the Geometry and Learning from Data in 3D and Beyond series at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA on an IPAM travel grant. Thanks for the travel support!
