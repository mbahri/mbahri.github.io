Our paper *Robust Kronecker Component Analysis* with I. Panagakis and S.
Zafeiriou has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Pattern
Analysis and Machine Intelligence (impact factor 2017: **9.455**).

This paper is a major extension of our ICCV 2017 paper and will be included in
the special issue on [Compact and Efficient Feature Representation and Learning in Computer Vision](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~lili/TPAMI2017_SI.htm).

The updated paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06432) and
in early access on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8536486).
