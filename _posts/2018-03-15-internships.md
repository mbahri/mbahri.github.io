I am fortunate to hold offers from two great companies for internships over the
Summer, JPMorgan in quantitative research in London, and Amazon for a research scientist internship in computer vision in Berlin.

After careful thinking, and this being the first year of my PhD, I have decided
to take the opportunity to explore a new field to get a broader perspective on
machine learning in the industry.

I am therefore excited to be joining JPMorgan's Systematic Trading team for an
Off-Cycle Internship in Quantitative Research!
