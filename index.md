<!-- I am a Data Scientist at [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk) in London where I do research and development. I graduated with an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, and a *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* in Applied Mathematics and CS from Ensimag (Grenoble). -->
I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer. I am currently finishing a research internship at [Speechmatics (Cantab Research Ltd.)](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I am working on improving the company's recurrent neural network language models. Prior to this, I was a Data Scientist at [HarperCollins Publishers](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk) in London. I graduated with an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, and a *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* in Applied Mathematics and CS from Ensimag (Grenoble).

See my [Curriculum Vitae](./Bahri_CV.pdf) or my short [Resume](./Bahri_resume.pdf).

## Current research interests

Besides what I do at work, I am interested in a variety of topics in Machine Learning, notably in statistical learning and optimisation.

* Non-euclidean geometry in Machine Learning (manifold learning, Riemannian optimisation)
* Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models
* Representation learning and component analysis
* Tensor methods, sparse coding, compressed sensing (see my MSc thesis)
* Social network analysis, more precisely influence propagation

My preferred applications are in data science, computer vision, and medical research.

## News

* July 2017: I have been selected as a semi-finalist for the Data Science fellowship by [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com).
* July 2017: My paper "Robust Kronecker-Decomposable Component Analysis for Low-Rank Modeling" has been accepted at [ICCV 2017](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com)!
<!-- * March 2017: Our paper "Robust Low-rank Tensor Modelling Using Tucker and CP Decomposition" has been accepted at EUSIPCO 2017! -->

## Projects

Below are some select projects

### MSc thesis at Imperial College London
*Robust low-rank modelling on tensors: new algorithms and extensive comparisons*

Supervisor: [Dr Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/)

* [Thesis in PDF](https://github.com/mbahri/msc_thesis/raw/master/MSc_Thesis_final.pdf)
* [Slides](https://github.com/mbahri/msc_thesis/raw/master/Slides_thesis.pdf)

[ICCV paper (arxiv preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07886) camera-ready version in preparation.
One paper co-authored for EUSIPCO 2017.

**Awarded the Winton Capital Computing MSc Project Prize** (best MSc thesis in Computer Science, 1/188 students)

### Robust non-negative dictionary learning
A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm from

> Robust Non-Negative Dictionary Learning Qihe Pan, Deguang Kong, Chris Ding and Bin Luo In Proceedings of the 28th conference of the AAAI - 2014

that I wrote for the paper I have submitted to ICCV 2017.

* [Code](https://github.com/mbahri/rnndl)

### A data science competition
I took part in the [Pump it Up](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/) competition hosted by DrivenData in May 2016 as part of the recruitment process of a London startup. With about two days of quick hacking at the time, I am currently in the top 7%.

* [Code (R)](https://github.com/mbahri/pumpitup)

### Bayesian optimisation for training RBMs

The purpose of this coursework was to experiment with Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs). I took it a step further and used Bayesian optimisation with [SMAC](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/SMAC/) to find good hyperparameters, and did a bit of statistical analysis to validate some hypothesis and findings.

* [Report](https://github.com/mbahri/rbm_bayesian_optimisation/raw/master/Report/DNSDL_cw2.pdf)
* [Code](https://github.com/mbahri/rbm_bayesian_optimisation)

<!-- ### Probabilistic inference of over-diagnosis
TODO -->

## Publications
* One *anonymous submission* to [CVPR 2017](http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com) with S. Zafeiriou and Y. Panagakis
* Work in progress for a journal version (PAMI, JMLR...)
